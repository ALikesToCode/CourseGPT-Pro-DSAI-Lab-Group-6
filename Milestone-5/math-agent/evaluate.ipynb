Let me break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I have 350 and 450. Let me write them down:\\n\\n350\\n+450\\n-------\\n\\nNow, I'll add the digits in each place value. Starting from the rightmost digit, which is the ones place.\\n\\nIn the ones place: 0 + 0 = 0. So I write 0 in the ones place of the answer.\\n\\nNext, the tens place: 5 + 5 = 10. Since this is a two-digit number, I write down the 0 in the tens place and carry over the 1 to the hundreds place.\\n\\nNow, the hundreds place: 3 + 4 = 7. Then add the carried-over 1: 7 + 1 = 8. So I write 8 in the hundreds place.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the sum should be 800. Let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\\n\\n350 + 450:\\n\\n350 + 400 = 750\\n\\n750 + 50 = 800\\n\\nYes, that's correct. So the answer is 800.\\n</think>To add 350 and 450, we can follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Write the numbers vertically, aligning the place values:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\\\,}c@{}c@{}c}\\n     & 3 & 5 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\n   + & 4 & 5 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\n   \\\\hline\\n   \\\\end{array}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n2. Start by adding the digits in the ones place:\\n   \\\\[\\n   0 + 0 = 0\\n   \\\\]\\n   Write down 0 in the ones place of the result:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\\\,}c@{}c@{}c}\\n     & 3 & 5 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\n   + & 4 & 5 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\n   \\\\hline\\n     &   &   & 0 \\\\\\\\\\n   \\\\end{array}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n3. Next, add the digits in the tens place:\\n   \\\\[\\n   5 + 5 = 10\\n   \\\\]\\n   Write down 0 in the tens place of the result and carry over 1 to the hundreds place:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\\\,}c@{}c@{}c}\\n     & \\\\stackrel{1}{3} & 5 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\n   + & 4 & 5 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\n   \\\\hline\\n     &   & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\n   \\\\end{array}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n4. Finally, add the digits in the hundreds place, including the carry-over:\\n   \\\\[\\n   3 + 4 + 1 = 8\\n   \\\\]\\n   Write down 8 in the hundreds place of the result:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\\\,}c@{}c@{}c}\\n     & \\\\stackrel{1}{3} & 5 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\n   + & 4 & 5 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\n   \\\\hline\\n     & 8 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\n   \\\\end{array}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\nThus, the sum of 350 and 450 is:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{800}\\n\\\\]\",\n",
