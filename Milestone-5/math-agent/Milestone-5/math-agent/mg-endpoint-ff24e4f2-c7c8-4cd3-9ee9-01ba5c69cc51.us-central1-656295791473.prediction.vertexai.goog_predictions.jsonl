Let me think. First, I should probably write down the numbers properly. The first one is a negative integer, -35947633, and the second one is a small decimal, 0.0337. \n\nSince one is a whole number and the other is a decimal, maybe I should convert them to the same form to make the addition easier. Let's see, 0.0337 is a very small number compared to 35947633. So, if I add them, the result will be a negative number, right? Because the absolute value of the negative number is way larger.\n\nBut to do the addition, maybe I can write both numbers with the same number of decimal places. Let's see, 0.0337 has four decimal places. The integer -35947633 can be written as -35947633.0000. That way, both numbers have four decimal places.\n\nNow, adding them: -35947633.0000 + 0.0337. Let's do that. Since one is negative and the other is positive, it's like subtracting the absolute values. The absolute value of -35947633 is 35947633, and the absolute value of 0.0337 is 0.0337. So, subtract 0.0337 from 35947633.\n\nCalculating 35947633 - 0.0337. Let's see, 35947633 minus 0.0337. Since 0.0337 is a very small number, subtracting it from 35947633 will give us 35947632.9663. But since the original number was negative, the result should be negative. So, the answer is -35947632.9663.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If I have -35947633 and add 0.0337, it's the same as -35947633 + 0.0337. Since 0.0337 is positive, I'm adding a small positive number to a large negative number. The result will be a negative number that's slightly less in magnitude than 35947633. So, 35947633 minus 0.0337 is 35947632.9663. Therefore, the answer is -35947632.9663.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me verify with another approach. Maybe convert both numbers to scientific notation. 35947633 is 3.5947633 \u00d7 10^7, and 0.0337 is 3.37 \u00d7 10^-2. But adding them directly in scientific notation might be tricky. Alternatively, since 0.0337 is so small compared to 35947633, the result is approximately -35947633. But since we need an exact answer, the subtraction gives us 35947632.9663, so the answer is negative. Yep, that seems right.\n</think>To add the numbers \\(-35947633\\) and \\(0.0337\\), we start by aligning the numbers with the same number of decimal places. The number \\(-35947633\\) can be written as \\(-35947633.0000\\) to match the decimal places of \\(0.0337\\).\n\nNext, we perform the addition:\n\\[\n-35947633.0000 + 0.0337\n\\]\n\nSince one number is negative and the other is positive, we subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger one and keep the sign of the larger number. The absolute value of \\(-35947633.0000\\) is \\(35947633.0000\\), and the absolute value of \\(0.0337\\) is \\(0.0337\\).\n\nSubtracting \\(0.0337\\) from \\(35947633.0000\\):\n\\[\n35947633.0000 - 0.0337 = 35947632.9663\n\\]\n\nSince the original number \\(-35947633.0000\\) is negative, the result is:\n\\[\n-35947632.9663\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-35947632.9663}\n\\]", "tool_calls": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "stop_reason": 106}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 169, "total_tokens": 1339, "completion_tokens": 1170, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "prompt_logprobs": null}}

Hmm, let's see. Adding numbers is pretty straightforward, right? I just need to combine the two numbers together. Let me think about how to do that. \n\nFirst, I know that when you add two numbers, you're essentially combining their values. So, 7 plus 303. Let me visualize it. If I have 303, and then I add 7 more, what do I get? \n\nMaybe I can break it down. 300 plus 7 is 307, and then there's the extra 3 from the 303. So 307 plus 3 is 310. Wait, does that make sense? Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, I can line them up vertically. So, \n\n  303\n+   7\n-------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit. 3 plus 7 is 10. So I write down 0 and carry over the 1 to the next column. The next column is 0 (from 303) plus 0 (from the carryover) plus 3 (from 303). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the original numbers are 303 and 7. So when I add them, the ones place is 3 + 7 = 10. So write down 0, carry over 1. Then the tens place in 303 is 0, and the tens place in 7 is 0. So 0 + 0 + 1 (carryover) is 1. Then the hundreds place in 303 is 3, and there's nothing in the hundreds place of 7. So 3 + 0 = 3. So putting it all together, it's 310. \n\nYeah, that seems right. Let me confirm with another method. If I start at 303 and count up 7 times. 303 + 1 = 304, +1=305, +1=306, +1=307, +1=308, +1=309, +1=310. Yep, that's 7 steps. So the answer is 310. \n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes here. The key was to add the digits column by column, carrying over when necessary. The vertical method helped break it down step by step. So the final answer should be 310.\n</think>To add 7 and 303, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers to be added:**\n   \\[\n   303 + 7\n   \\]\n\n2. **Align the numbers vertically by place value:**\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\,}c@{}c@{}c}\n     & 3 & 0 & 3 \\\\\n   + &   &   & 7 \\\\\n   \\hline\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Add the digits in the ones place:**\n   \\[\n   3 + 7 = 10\n   \\]\n   Write down 0 in the ones place and carry over 1 to the tens place.\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\,}c@{}c@{}c}\n     & 3 & \\stackrel{1}{0} & 3 \\\\\n   + &   &   & 7 \\\\\n   \\hline\n     &   &   & 0 \\\\\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Add the digits in the tens place, including the carry-over:**\n   \\[\n   0 + 0 + 1 = 1\n   \\]\n   Write down 1 in the tens place.\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\,}c@{}c@{}c}\n     & 3 & \\stackrel{1}{0} & 3 \\\\\n   + &   &   & 7 \\\\\n   \\hline\n     &   & 1 & 0 \\\\\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Add the digits in the hundreds place:**\n   \\[\n   3 + 0 = 3\n   \\]\n   Write down 3 in the hundreds place.\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\,}c@{}c@{}c}\n     & 3 & \\stackrel{1}{0} & 3 \\\\\n   + &   &   & 7 \\\\\n   \\hline\n     & 3 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Combine the results to get the final sum:**\n   \\[\n   310\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{310}\n\\]", "tool_calls": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "stop_reason": 106}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 158, "total_tokens": 1253, "completion_tokens": 1095, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "prompt_logprobs": null}}

So, 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 tens. So, I write down 6 in the tens place.\n\nThen, the hundreds place. 318 has 3 hundreds, and there's nothing to add to it from the other number. So, the hundreds place remains 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the sum should be 3 hundreds, 6 tens, and 0 ones, which is 360. Let me check that again. 300 + 60 + 0 = 360. Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can add 42 and 318 directly. Let's see: 318 + 42. Starting from the right, 8 + 2 = 10. Write down 0, carry over 1. Then 1 + 1 + 4 = 6. Then the 3 in the hundreds place. So, 360. Yep, same result. So, the answer should be 360.\n</think>To add 42 and 318, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers and their place values:**\n   - 42 can be broken down as 4 tens and 2 ones.\n   - 318 can be broken down as 3 hundreds, 1 ten, and 8 ones.\n\n2. **Add the ones place:**\n   - 2 ones + 8 ones = 10 ones.\n   - Since 10 ones is equivalent to 1 ten and 0 ones, we write down 0 in the ones place and carry over 1 to the tens place.\n\n3. **Add the tens place:**\n   - 4 tens + 1 ten + 1 ten (carried over) = 6 tens.\n   - We write down 6 in the tens place.\n\n4. **Add the hundreds place:**\n   - 3 hundreds + 0 hundreds = 3 hundreds.\n   - We write down 3 in the hundreds place.\n\n5. **Combine the results:**\n   - The sum is 3 hundreds, 6 tens, and 0 ones, which is 360.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{360}\n\\]", "tool_calls": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "stop_reason": 106}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 159, "total_tokens": 892, "completion_tokens": 733, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "prompt_logprobs": null}}

So I write down 0 in the ones place and carry over the 1 to the tens place.\n\nNow, moving to the tens place. There's 3 in the tens place of 339, and 9 in the tens place of 91. Plus the carryover 1. So 3 + 9 + 1. Let me calculate that. 3 + 9 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So I write down 3 in the tens place and carry over the 1 to the hundreds place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. 3 in 339, and there's nothing in the hundreds place of 91, but we have a carryover 1. So 3 + 1 = 4. So I write 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nPutting it all together, the sum should be 430. Let me check that again. 339 + 91. 339 + 10 is 349, then subtract 1 because we added an extra 1 earlier. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, maybe another way. 300 + 90 is 390, then 390 + 1 is 391. Wait, no, that's not adding 91. Wait, 339 + 91. Let's break it down. 300 + 90 = 390, then 390 + 1 = 391. Wait, but 339 + 91 is actually 339 + 90 + 1 = 429 + 1 = 430. Yes, that's correct.

Then 360 has 3 in the hundreds, 6 in the tens, and 0 in the ones. \n\nWhen I add them, I start from the rightmost digit, which is the ones place. Both numbers have 0 there, so 0 + 0 is 0. Then the tens place: 4 + 6. Let me calculate that. 4 plus 6 is 10. So I write down 0 in the tens place and carry over the 1 to the hundreds place. Now, the hundreds place: 1 + 3 plus the carryover 1. That's 1 + 3 + 1 = 5. So the hundreds place is 5. \n\nPutting it all together, the sum should be 500. Let me check that again. 140 + 360. If I break it down, 100 + 300 is 400, and 40 + 60 is 100. Then 400 + 100 is 500. Yep, that matches. So the answer should be 500.\n</think>To add 140 and 360, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the place values:**\n   - 140 has 1 in the hundreds place, 4 in the tens place, and 0 in the ones place.\n   - 360 has 3 in the hundreds place, 6 in the tens place, and 0 in the ones place.\n\n2. **Add the digits starting from the ones place:**\n   - Ones place: \\(0 + 0 = 0\\)\n   - Tens place: \\(4 + 6 = 10\\). Write down 0 and carry over 1 to the hundreds place.\n   - Hundreds place: \\(1 + 3 + 1 \\text{ (carry-over)} = 5\\)\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   - The sum is 500.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{500}\n\\]", "tool_calls": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "stop_reason": 106}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 160, "total_tokens": 714, "completion_tokens": 554, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "prompt_logprobs": null}}

Wait, actually, the problem just says to add them, so the order doesn't matter. Let me check:\n\n  363\n+ 147\n-------\n\nAlright, starting from the rightmost digit, which is the ones place. 3 plus 7. 3 + 7 is 10. So I write down 0 in the ones place and carry over the 1 to the tens place.\n\nNow, moving to the tens place. There's a 6 in the tens place of 363 and a 4 in the tens place of 147. Plus the carryover 1. So 6 + 4 + 1 = 11. Write down 1 in the tens place and carry over another 1 to the hundreds place.\n\nNow the hundreds place. 3 in 363 and 1 in 147. Plus the carryover 1. So 3 + 1 + 1 = 5. Write down 5 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo putting it all together, the sum should be 510. Let me check that again. 363 + 147. Let's see, 300 + 100 is 400. Then 60 + 40 is 100, so 400 + 100 is 500. Then 3 + 7 is 10. So 500 + 10 is 510. Yep, that matches.

So I write down 0 and carry over the 1 to the next column, which is the tens place.\n\nNow, the tens place: 8 (from 189) plus 8 (from 381) is 16. Then add the carryover 1, making it 17. So I write down 7 and carry over 1 to the hundreds place.\n\nMoving to the hundreds place: 1 (from 189) plus 3 (from 381) is 4. Then add the carryover 1, making it 5. So I write down 5.\n\nPutting it all together, the sum should be 570. Let me check that again. 189 plus 381. If I break it down, 100 + 300 is 400, 80 + 80 is 160, and 9 + 1 is 10. Adding those together: 400 + 160 = 560, plus 10 is 570. Yep, that matches. So the answer should be 570.\n</think>To add 189 and 381, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Align the numbers vertically by their place values:**\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\,}c@{}c@{}c}\n     & 1 & 8 & 9 \\\\\n   + & 3 & 8 & 1 \\\\\n   \\hline\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Start with the ones place:**\n   - Add the digits in the ones place: \\(9 + 1 = 10\\).\n   - Write down 0 and carry over 1 to the tens place.\n\n3. **Move to the tens place:**\n   - Add the digits in the tens place along with the carryover: \\(8 + 8 + 1 = 17\\).\n   - Write down 7 and carry over 1 to the hundreds place.\n\n4. **Move to the hundreds place:**\n   - Add the digits in the hundreds place along with the carryover: \\(1 + 3 + 1 = 5\\).\n   - Write down 5.\n\n5. **Combine the results:**\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\,}c@{}c@{}c}\n     & 1 & 8 & 9 \\\\\n   + & 3 & 8 & 1 \\\\\n   \\hline\n     & 5 & 7 & 0 \\\\\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the sum of 189 and 381 is \\(\\boxed{570}\\).", "tool_calls": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "stop_reason": 106}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 160, "total_tokens": 904, "completion_tokens": 744, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "prompt_logprobs": null}}

So, 196 has a 1 in the hundreds place, a 9 in the tens place, and a 6 in the ones place. Then 384 has a 3 in the hundreds, 8 in the tens, and 4 in the ones. \n\nFirst, I'll add the ones digits: 6 + 4. That's 10. Since it's more than 9, I need to carry over the 1 to the tens place. So now, the ones place is 0, and I carry over 1.\n\nNext, adding the tens digits: 9 + 8 + the carryover 1. That's 9 + 8 = 17, plus 1 is 18. Again, that's more than 9, so I carry over the 1 to the hundreds place. The tens place now is 8.\n\nFinally, adding the hundreds digits: 1 + 3 + the carryover 1. That's 1 + 3 = 4, plus 1 is 5. So the hundreds place is 5.\n\nPutting it all together, the sum should be 580. Let me check that again. 196 + 384. If I break it down: 196 + 300 is 496, then 496 + 84. 84 + 496. Let's see, 496 + 80 is 576, then 576 + 4 is 580. Yep, that matches.
